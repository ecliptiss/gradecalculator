# CMS Grade Calculator
This is a small web application intended to help Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) middle & high school students calculate their grades. It uses the preestablished weightings of Prepare (20%), Rehearse (30%), and Perform (50%). Users cannot change these weighting percentages.

For students, this offers an easy way to test the effects of an upcoming test, quiz, etc. on your final grade. The app has an easily understandable UI with clear directions for how to input grades.

## Features
- Two input methods: Auto Import allows for direct extraction from InfiniteCampus, while Manual Import allows for user to input grades into categories
- Clear navigation and separate pages for each import screen
- Dynamic count of grades per category in Manual Import
- Display of prepare, rehearse, and perform averages on the results screen along with final grade
- Warnings of invalid data
